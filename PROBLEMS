Known Bugs / Problems:

if you've found a bug, that isn't listed here, please contact me

- if BorderWidth is 0, you can't change the virtual position of the root desktop
  by moving the mouse out of it (does anybody know how to capture this event
  without selecting for MotionEvents?).

- keycodes don't work while numlock is on. if you want to change this
  behaviour, you just have to make sure that there's a file
    /usr/lib/X11/xkb/X0-config.keyboard
  containing the line
    IgnoreLockMods=NumLock+Lock

- wine makes its windows override redirect by default, so treewm windows can't
  be raised above. start wine with --managed or define an alias to avoid this.

- apps that want to move themselves usually don't understand that they have
  to set their gravity to static in order to be able to determine their static
  gravity correctly. The current workaround is to make all windows static if
  they request to have no title by MWM hints. No problems with that are known 
  any more.

- xprop/xkill, motif drag&drop, as well as most application that use
  XmuClientWindow() assume that each top level window has at most one(!)
  application window. Since this is obviously not the case in treewm,
  several problems occur.
  I patched xprop and xkill so that they work with treewm you can build the
  patches by
    $ make patches
    $ make patchinstall

- xawtv has to be patched in order to be able to calculate the visible region
  properly (write me a mail if you want the patch)

- In order to receive all VisibilityChange events programs apparently must call
  XSelectInput for all parents of windows that may cause the visibility change.
  So they have to select for both ReparentNotify and VisibilityChange events of
  all their parents and parents of parents and if they receive an
  ReparentNotify event do the same shit again. However, there's no program that
  does so (and treewm is the only wm so far for which this is important).
  This yields to annoying problems with TV applications like xawtv that do not
  know when to recalculate the region they can draw on.
  There are two workarounds: Patch the applications or select for
  VisibitityChange Events in treewm and forward them to the children (which
  cause high traffic and would thus slow down the wm if the clients are
  connected via a low bandwidth line).
  However, Expose events are generated correctly.
